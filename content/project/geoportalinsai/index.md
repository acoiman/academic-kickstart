<p style='text-align: justify;'>The Geoportal INSAI  was conceived as a tool to leverage the national plant protection and animal health system in Venezuela. It was based on open-source software, using <a href="https://mapserver.org/" target="_blank">MapServer</a> for publishing geospatial data, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.gvsig.com/en/products/i3geo" target="_blank">i3Geo</a>, which is an application for developing interactive web maps.</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>Geoportal INSAI displayed several predefined web map interfaces: regions, INSAI's offices, transit permits, epidemiology reports, and so on. Equally,  it was possible that a user could create his own map and make spatial analysis directly on the web.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Unfortunately, this geoportal is currently offline. However,  you can obtain more information about this project from the <a href="http://www.gvsig.com/en" target="_blank">gvSIG association</a> by clicking <a href="http://box5589.temp.domains/~gvsigorg//category/country/venezuela" target="_blank">here</a>  and <a href="https://bit.ly/3deIvGn" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
