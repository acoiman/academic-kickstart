<p style='text-align: justify;'>The main goal of this activity was to create an ArcGIS StoryMap to show the shoreline dynamics of the Valencia lake and the magnitude of Land Use and Land Cover changes in Zamora Municipality, Venezuela from 1986 to 2014. This StoryMap was conceived as a means to show the results of a postgraduate thesis, and to take part in the National Award for Geographical Information System 2018 (NASIG), ESRI-Venezuela. We opted to build an <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">ArcGIS StoryMap</a> because it is an application based on the web and the ArcGIS platform that allows developer to share maps in a setting containing narrative text and multimedia. This story map won the third prize for the best Story Map, more details <a href="https://bit.ly/2KRJboP" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
