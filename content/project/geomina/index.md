<p style='text-align: justify;'>The main goal of the Mining Geoportal (GeoMiNa) is to serve as a central repository for all data related to mining activities in Venezuela. GeoMiNa is a free and open data resource intended to support public and private management in the mining sector, as well as a means to exchange data between stakeholders. GeoMiNa’s users will be the staff of the Mining Ministry <a href="http://www.desarrollominero.gob.ve/" target="_blank">(MPPDME)</a> and the Institute for Geology and Mining (INGEOMIN), who will use the data for mining research and planning in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.</p>
