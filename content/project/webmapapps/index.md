<p style='text-align: justify;'>The main goal of this project was to developed web mapping applications for environmental and territorial management in the Aragua state. These web maps were the first mapping tools developed to help regional government staff to visualize geospatial data about the environment and land use planning.  The web mapping applications contain information about land use planning, roads, hydrography, urban areas, protected areas, administrative boundaries, and current and potential mining activities.  The main portal of the project shows 4 web mapping application and one mobile application. Three apps are for land use planning and two apps are for mining.</p>
