abstract: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Advances in information technology allow people to visualize and analyze geographical data shared from computer to computer via Internet. Modern applications to build interactive web maps are classify according to the way of data storage. In this respect, we have those that imply the acquisition of information storage services like ArcGIS Online, and those that involve the administration and managing of own servers. I3Geo is an application for the development of interactive web maps. It integrates several open source applications into a single development platform, mainly Mapserver and OpenLayers. Basically, i3Geo consist of two interfaces: user interface intended for visualizing and geoprocessing , and a management interface for interactive management of geospatial data. In Venezuela there are two cases of i3geo implementation: Geoportal INSAI and PDVSA Oriente.</p>"
