abstract: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Valencia lake basin is located in the central region of Venezuela between Aragua and Carabobo states. During the last four decades it has experienced a significant urban sprawl. This situation has created important land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially in areas near the shore of Valencia lake. It is important to highlight the case of Zamora municipality where this phenomenon has affected lands with high potential for agricultural use. Considering these circumstances, this research has as main goal evaluating the costal dynamics of Valencia lake and LULC changes in Zamora municipality between 1980 and 2014. To characterize LULC changes, the object-oriented classification of multispectral medium-spatial resolution satellite images was employed. SISDELAV (Sistema de Información de Suelos de la Depresión del Lago de Valencia) data and image classification outputs were used to pinpoint coastal evolution of Valencia lake. A spatial analysis was carried out using SISDELAV data, classified images and GIS, in order to identify areas in conflict with potential for agricultural use, coastal evolution of the lake, and LULC changes. Finally, the resulting geospatial information was integrated into a WebGIS application.</p>"
